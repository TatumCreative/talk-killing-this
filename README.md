# Killing JavaScript's `this`

### Practical Functional Programming

In my talk I'll be deconstructing what happens when you type `new Something()` in JavaScript and how to use ideas from functional programming to maybe change the way you think about object oriented patterns.

The talk will explain in gritty detail the new constructor, lexical scope, how to store state in functions, and explore using these ideas to build and compose modules.
